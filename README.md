# Meragix

High-Performance Software Engineering for the Dart & Flutter Ecosystem.
Meragix is an open-source development studio dedicated to building robust, modular, and extremely high-performance tools. Our mission is to provide Flutter developers with a unified "Core Stack," eliminating architectural complexity so you can focus on building great user experiences.

## Our Vision

The Meragix philosophy is built on three core pillars:

1. **Total Consistency**: Tools that share the same design language, syntax, and seamless integration.
2. **Raw Performance**: Every package is optimized to minimize memory footprint and maximize execution speed.
3. **Developer Experience (DX)**: Intuitive, type-safe APIs with documentation that leaves no room for doubt.
