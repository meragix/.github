# Meragix

High-Performance Software Engineering for the Dart & Flutter Ecosystem.

## Vision

Meragix isn't a collection of weekend experiments or quick hacks. These packages are battle-tested solutions born from real-world problems I've encountered over years of Flutter development. Every package in this ecosystem is currently being used in production applications I actively maintain and develop.

## Why Meragix Exists

As a full-stack developer building Flutter applications day in and day out, I kept running into the same frustrations: reinventing authentication flows, managing server state, validating data, and dealing with dependency health issues. Instead of copying boilerplate code between projects or settling for incomplete solutions, I decided to build the tools I wish existed.

**This is my daily toolkit**. If a package is here, it's because I depend on it. If it breaks, my apps break. This personal stake means you can trust that:

- **Long-term commitment** - These aren't throwaway projects. I'm invested for the long haul.
- **Real-world tested** - Every feature exists because it solved an actual problem in production.
- **Actively maintained** - I use these packages daily, so bugs get fixed fast.
- **Evolution over revolution** - Breaking changes are minimized because they affect my own projects too.

## Principles

- **Developer Experience First** - Intuitive APIs that feel natural
- **Performance Matters** - Zero unnecessary overhead
- **Documentation Driven** - Every feature is well-documented
- **Test Coverage** - Reliability through comprehensive testing
- **Community Powered** - Built with and for the community
- **Production-First** - No vaporware, only tools that work in real applications

## Packages

###

**Meragix** is not a collection of experimental tools.
Every package exists because it has been used, tested, and refined in real-world applications.
Philosophy
Meragix follows a simple principle:
Build tools that you can trust today, and still rely on years from now.
This ecosystem is shaped by production constraints, not trends.
Design decisions are guided by maintainability, clarity, and long-term stability.
Core principles:
Stability over novelty
Features are introduced only when they solve real problems.
Explicit and predictable APIs
No magic, no hidden behaviors.
Composable architecture
Packages are independent but designed to work seamlessly together.
Production-first mindset
Every tool is built and evolved through real application usage.
Long-Term Commitment
Meragix is built for the long run.
All packages in this ecosystem:
are actively used in production
evolve based on real feedback and constraints
prioritize backward compatibility
avoid unnecessary breaking changes
are documented and versioned carefully
The goal is not to publish many packages, but to maintain a small, coherent, and dependable ecosystem.
This is not vibe code.
It is infrastructure.

## Ecosystem Overview

| Package  | Role | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Zema** | Validation | Ultra-fast, Zod-inspired schema validation for Dart. |
| **Qora** | Data | Reactive server-state management and intelligent caching. |
| **Authyra** | Security | Unified authentication framework for Flutter. |
| **Cura** | Audit | Project health sentry and dependency vulnerability auditor. |

Package Role Description Status

Domain
Package
Description
Authentication & Security
Authyra
Session management, authentication flows, guards, and security primitives.
Data Fetching / Server State

Each package can be used independently or combined to form a complete foundation.Package Design Rules
All Meragix packages follow the same internal rules:
minimal dependencies
clear separation of concerns
predictable lifecycle and behavior
consistent naming and structure
no hidden global state
If a feature cannot be implemented cleanly, it does not belong in the package.
Who This Is For
Meragix is designed for developers who:
build applications meant to last
care about architecture and maintainability
prefer clear abstractions over clever tricks
want tools that evolve carefully instead of constantly changing
If you are building serious Flutter applications, Meragix aims to be a reliable foundation.
Contribution
Contributions are welcome, but quality always comes first.
Before submitting a change:
Make sure it solves a real, well-defined problem
Keep APIs explicit and stable
Avoid introducing breaking changes
Include documentation and tests when relevant
The ecosystem grows intentionally, not rapidly.
Status
Meragix is actively maintained and evolving as part of real production work.
Updates are driven by usage, not by release schedules.
Closing Note
Meragix is not about reinventing Flutter.
It is about providing solid, dependable building blocks that respect developers’ time and projects.
Meragix — Foundations for Flutter applications that are built to last.

High-Performance Software Engineering for the Dart & Flutter Ecosystem.
Meragix is an open-source development studio dedicated to building robust, modular, and extremely high-performance tools. Our mission is to provide Flutter developers with a unified "Core Stack," eliminating architectural complexity so you can focus on building great user experiences.

## Our Vision

The Meragix philosophy is built on three core pillars:
